# Express Setup Basics

Setting up an Express server just like before with http.createServer on vanilla js but its way more concise, cleaner, and ready for real backend projects.

## Flow

1. Install Express via npm (I install mine on root directory)
2. Require express
3. Create an app instance using express()
4. Set a port
5. Start the server with app.listen(...)
