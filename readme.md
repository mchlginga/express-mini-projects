## Projects

1. **Basic Server** - Simple Express server setup
2. **Notes API** - Full CRUD operations with file storage
3. **User Management API** - User registration, authentication, and management (JSON file storage)
4. **User Management API MongoDB** - Same functionality upgraded with MongoDB database
5. **Notes API Mongoose** -

## Learning Journey

This repo documents my progression from file-based to database-driven applications:

1. **File Storage Era** - Built APIs using JSON files for data persistence
2. **Database Era** - Migrating to MongoDB for proper data management

I already built some mini-projects in vanilla Node (using http, fs, path, etc). Now, this repo helps me:

- Learn how Express simplifies backend workflows
- Understand middleware and modular structure
- Write clean, maintainable backend code
- Master database integration with MongoDB
- Build production-ready APIs

This is my foundation before building full-stack applications and my capstone project.

## Getting Started

Each project has its own directory with:

- Individual README with setup instructions
- Complete source code
- Example API requests
- Database setup (where applicable)

---

## Next Steps

- Complete MongoDB integration
- Build full-stack capstone project
- Deploy to production
